# Run the models

The makefile will compile dependencies.

Run `make mesh` to get the meshes as well.

Start with running initialize.sif

## Forward simulations
Run all_forward.sh for no horizontal shear.

You can then run all_oop_forward.sh to do the horizontally sheared simulations.

## Backward simulations
Run all_backward.sh and all_oop_backward.sh.
